This initially listed cards with either a 1 or 3 point global penalty. Each copy of a card with a penalty reduced the influence limit of the deck's identity by that penalty. The final iteration of the MWL replaced this with universal influence, which instead added an additional influence cost to affected cards. This system was then replaced by the NAPD MWL, which specified a list of banned and restricted cards, making it the first banlist to actually ban cards. Cards that were banned could not be included in Standard decks. Decks that contained at least one copy of a card on the restricted list could not include any other cards on the restricted list. When Null Signal Games took over the game, they removed the restricted list for simplicity, meaning cards are now either banned or completely unrestricted for Standard play."

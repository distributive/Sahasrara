-- * DatabaseDiscord

-- | The monad transformer stack used to represent computations that work with
-- the database and Discord. The top layer is for Persistent/Esqueleto database
-- operations - the main event handler is run through @runSqlPool@ to leave us
-- with a 'DiscordHandler' for our Discord operations.
--
-- "Sahasrara.Plugin.Discord" provides some helper functions for
-- running Discord operations without excessive use of @lift@.
type EnvDatabaseDiscord d = ReaderT d (ReaderT (MVar SahasraraCache) (SqlPersistT DiscordHandler))

type DatabaseDiscord = EnvDatabaseDiscord ()

-- | @Database@ The monad transformer stack used to represent computations that work with
-- the just the database for startup actions.

-- * Parser

-- | A simple definition for parsers on Text.
type Parser = Parsec Void Text

-- * Features

-- Bot functionality is split into /features/, which are combined into plugins.
-- Each feature is its own type, and the features are combined via records into
-- full plugins.

-- | For when the plugin is first used, to ensure that certain data is
-- available.
newtype StartUp d = StartUp
  { -- | An action to run at startup
    startAction :: Database d
  }

-- | For when you get a 'MessageCreate'. Checks that the @name@ is directly
-- after the bot prefix, and then runs @commandParser@ on it.
-- It will first try to match against any subcommands, and if that fails it runs
-- the commandParser.
data EnvCommand d = Command
  { -- | The name of the command.
    commandName :: Text,
    -- | A parser to run on the command arguments, returning a computation to
    -- run in 'DatabaseDiscord'.
    commandParser :: Parser (Message -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()),
    -- | A list of subcommands to attempt to parse before the bare command,
    -- matching their name.
    commandSubcommands :: [EnvCommand d]
  }

type Command = EnvCommand ()

-- | Construct an aliased command that behaves the same as another command (for
-- things like short forms).
commandAlias :: Text -> EnvCommand d -> EnvCommand d
commandAlias name' (Command _ cp sc) = Command name' cp sc

-- | For when you get a 'MessageCreate', but instead of wanting to match on
-- "!name args" (for prefix "!"), you want a more general match. Useful for
-- commands that work with brackets or look for keywords.
newtype EnvInlineCommand d = InlineCommand
  { -- | The parser to run on every message (non-bot) received.
    inlineCommandParser :: Parser (Message -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ())
  }

type InlineCommand = EnvInlineCommand ()

-- | How to handle any messages changing. Called on Discord's 'MessageUpdate',
-- 'MessageDelete' and 'MessageDeleteBulk'. Useful for admin bots such as the
-- ub3rbot ub3rlog functionality.
newtype EnvMessageChange d = MessageChange
  { -- | A function to call on every message update. The first argument is
    -- whether the message was updated (True) or deleted (False).
    -- Will be run once per message if bulk deletion occurs.
    onMessageChange :: Bool -> ChannelId -> MessageId -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type MessageChange = EnvMessageChange ()

-- | Handles added reactions, which is useful for reaction-based functionality
-- (e.g. a quote bot that quotes messages reacted to with a certain emoji).
-- Tied to 'MessageReactionAdd' from Discord.
newtype EnvReactionAdd d = ReactionAdd
  { -- | A function to call on every reaction add, which takes in details of
    -- that reaction ('ReactionInfo').
    onReactionAdd :: ReactionInfo -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type ReactionAdd = EnvReactionAdd ()

-- | Handles removed reactions, which is useful in the same way as adding
-- reactions. Called on 'MessageReactionRemove'.
newtype EnvReactionDel d = ReactionDel
  { -- | A function to call on every individual reaction delete, which takes in
    -- details of that reaction ('ReactionInfo').
    onReactionDelete :: ReactionInfo -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type ReactionDel = EnvReactionDel ()

-- | Handles the creation of an application command and of the action to be
-- performed once that application command is received.
--
-- This handles things like chat input (slash commands), message commands, or
-- user commands. The `applicationCommand` is the data structure that
-- represents the application command, and the `applicationCommandRecv` is the
-- action to be performed when this application command is received.
data EnvApplicationCommandRecv d = ApplicationCommandRecv
  { -- | The application command to be created.
    applicationCommand :: CreateApplicationCommand,
    -- | The action to run when the application command is received.
    applicationCommandRecv :: Interaction -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type ApplicationCommandRecv = EnvApplicationCommandRecv ()

-- | Handles recieving of components, such as buttons or select menus.
--
-- The name is the name of the component within a plugin. Choose something
-- unique within the plugin.
data EnvComponentRecv d = ComponentRecv
  { componentName :: Text,
    onComponentRecv :: Interaction -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type ComponentRecv = EnvComponentRecv ()

-- | Handles events not covered by the other kinds of features. This is only
-- relevant to specific admin functionality, such as the deletion of channels.
newtype EnvOther d = Other
  { -- | A function to call on every other event, which takes in details of
    -- that event.
    onOtherEvent :: Event -> EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type Other = EnvOther ()

-- | A feature for cron jobs - events which are run every @timeframe@
-- microseconds, regardless of any other interaction with the bot. Useful for
-- things like reminders.
--
-- Note that the loop starts with calling @onCron@ and /then/ delaying, so they
-- will all be invoked on bot start.
data EnvCronJob d = CronJob
  { -- | Delay between each call of @onCron@, in microseconds.
    timeframe :: Int,
    -- | Computation to do with each invocation of this cron job.
    onCron :: EnvDatabaseDiscord d ()
  }

type CronJob = EnvCronJob ()

-- | A feature for generating help text
-- Each help text page consists of a explanation body, as well as a list of
-- sub-pages that display the short text for its page
data HelpPage = HelpPage
  { -- | The [sub]command name
    helpName :: Text,
    -- | List of aliases for this command
    helpAliases :: [Text],
    -- | The text to show when listed in a subpage list. Will be prefixed by its
    -- helpName
    helpShortText :: Text,
    -- | The text to show when specifically listed. Appears above the list of
    -- subpages
    helpBody :: Text,
    -- | A list of help pages that can be recursively accessed
    helpSubpages :: [HelpPage],
    -- | Permission required to run
    helpPermission :: RequiredPermission
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Automatic handling of command permissions
-- @UserPermission@ models the current permissions of the user
-- @RequiredPermission@ models the permissions required to run a command.
-- Note, superusers can run all commands
-- -- None: Any user can run the command
-- -- Moderator: The user must be a moderator
-- -- Superuser: The user must be a superuser
data UserPermission = UserPerm
  { permModerator :: Bool,
    permSuperuser :: Bool
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data RequiredPermission = None | Any | Exec | Moderator | Both | Superuser deriving (Show, Eq)

-- * Plugins

-- Plugins are groups of features that forms some functionality of your bot.
-- For example, you could have a Reminder bot (see
-- "Sahasrara.Plugins.Reminder") that has a command for issuing
-- reminders, a cron job for doing them and then a migration that works with
-- the database.

-- | A plugin. Directly constructing these should be avoided (hence why it is
-- not exported by "Sahasrara.Plugin") as this structure could change.
